I am a PhD candidate in Demography at the London School of Economics and Political Science. In Demography, I is interested in widening the use of web-based data in fertility research. His doctoral research focusses on the digitalisation of fertility, the use of the internet and apps in relation to relationships and fertility, and the expressions of parenthood online. My methodological interests are in computational social science, web scraping, and natural language processing.

I hold a BA in Geography from the University of Leeds and an MSc in Demography from the University of Southampton. Prior to starting his PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Vienna Institute of Demography, Austrian Academy of Sciences. During his time there, he researched the uncertainty surrounding fertility, and how the intention to have a child changes throughout life.
