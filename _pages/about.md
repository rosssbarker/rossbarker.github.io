I work on answering questions that relate to the social pressures affecting fertility. These pressures are often difficult to quantify and measure. I appraoch these questions by using text-based sources and quantitative text analysis while following critical and concerned demography principles. To do so, I rely on historical text data from books and newspapers, as well as contemporary web-based data. My methodological interests are in computational social science, web scraping, and natural language processing. I am interested in the philosophy of science and the role of methodologies, and the changing techniques demographers and social scientists ada[t tjeor tecjmoqies for creating their theories, research questions, and identifying problems.

I am currently a second-year PhD candidate in demography at the London School of Economics and Political Science. I have a BA in Geography from the University of Leeds and an MSc in Demography from the University of Southampton. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Vienna Institute of Demography, Austrian Academy of Sciences. During my time there, I researched the uncertainty of fertility, the evolutoin of fertility intentions throughout life, and the sue of mobile phone apps for fertility tracking.
